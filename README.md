This is the source code for all Crypto-Cadet Academy Lessons.

Part 1 - Dynamic Smart Contracts

In this section, you will work through real intermediate-level projects involving only Solidity. Projects such as those that require soulbinding, 
custom interfaces, on-chain metadata storage and svg attribute modification, and intermediate-level optimization and security skills. You will also
learn the difference between the upgradable standards UUPS and Transparent and how to deploy them through Remix IDE and Hardhat.


Part 2 - Introduction to DApps

Coming Soon. In this section you will build a frontend using ReactJS and NextJS, make calls to your contract using web3js library, and utilize APIs 
to get information from the blockchain for your app. 


Part 3 - Hybrid Approach to Web3 

Coming Soon. In this section you will begin applying everything you've learned so far and create solutions to tackle complex problems arising from 
more sophisticated projects, such as setting up databases for KYC, traditional login setup and authentication, or enabling credit card payments 
for marketplaces that accept both. Upon completion of this section, you should be able to handle any web2 or web3 frontend developer project that
comes your way.
